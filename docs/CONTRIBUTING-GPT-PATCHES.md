# Contributing â€“ GPT Patch Convention

This repository adopts a standardized convention for patches generated by ChatGPT to ensure traceability, easy rollbacks, and consistent documentation.

## Tag Comments (required for every change)
Use short, greppable tags around modified blocks/lines:

```php
// [SOCIALSUITE][GPT][YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM +07] FIX: short description
// [SOCIALSUITE][GPT] WHY: reason for the change
// [SOCIALSUITE][GPT] IMPACT: affected modules/components
// [SOCIALSUITE][GPT] TEST: quick steps to verify
// [SOCIALSUITE][GPT] ROLLBACK: how to revert if needed
```

For larger blocks (new classes/functions), include a header docblock with the same fields.

## Feature Flags
When a change could affect runtime behavior broadly, add a feature flag in `.env` and `.env.example`:
```
SOCIALSUITE_FEATURE_SOMETHING=true
```
Guard new logic with that flag, allowing quick enable/disable in production.

## Patches Folder
Include a unified diff for each change in `patches/`:
```
patches/YYYY-MM-DD_short-description.patch
```
The diff should be applicable via `git apply` or any standard patch tool.

## Patch Log
Update `PATCHLOG.md` for each patch with:
- Summary
- Files touched
- Tests (quick steps)
- Rollback (revert or flag-off)
